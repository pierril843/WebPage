            responsible for telling the Elevator node to move. The supervisor alongside apache ran a MySQL instance to keep track of requests and the current state in the state machine. On the website, php was used to modify and make requests to the
            database. Javascript was used to give a live update of the car along with the recent request logs. </p>

        <h4>HCS12 Controller Design</h4>
        <p>2016 - 2nd Year Project</p>
        <img class="thumbnail" src="./Photos/IMAG0313.jpg">
        <div class="showmore">

        <div id="Controller" style="display:none">
          <p>Overview: This programmable HCS12 based microcontroller project was the pride of the Embedded system engineering program and would go one to become the backbone of future projects. Designed by each student in 2nd year, this microcontroller uses an HCS12 processor as its core, and housed the circuitly and pinouts for many input/output interfaces.</p>
          <p>Capabilities: A power source of 12V DC is stepped down to to serve as the supply for a safe 5 volts. The controller supplies pinouts for a servo and stepper motor making it very useful on later projects that require low resistance motion. it  is capable of driving two dc motors directly and to add to the accuracy there are two sets of pinouts that are reserved for a pair of encoders, allowing for software PID to control speeds/voltage output.</p>
          <p>Communication: This controller is able to communicate with the outside work via a couple different means. Outside of the motor drivers it can power and edit the text of an added LCD display (16x2) to display system updates and changes. This would go on to be very useful for light debugging and live error or warning to be displayed. So that covers output but are there any input methods? Yes we also allow you to attach a mic to make use of onboard ADC (modification can be made to allow any number of analog signals to be encoded).  Though a controller with no way to send live commands or instructions would be neat but not useful for all situations so there is also the ability to communicate using RS-232 cable. Communication over the RS-232 line would be a custom protocol depending on the tasks and size requirements for data. The addition of error detection was added to many projects to help with line signal degradation.</p>
          <p>Debugging: The ability to step through code on the live target is very useful so we of course would tap into the uncluded functionality of the MCUâ€™s BDM port. In attadition the software used (codewarrior) allowed use to simulation running tasks on they NXP MCU (HCS12) before flashing the target.</p>
