          <p>The elevator project consisted of controlling a miniature elevator over a CAN network, interface the CAN network to a local network (apache on Supervisor node) and create a front end website that allows diagnostic controls. In total the
            network had 6 nodes; all nodes except the supervisor is a HCS12-based board:</p>
          <p>- 1-3 Floor Nodes - Each floor has a button for requesting the elevator via CAN, and LEDs would keep track of which floor the elevator is on by monitoring the messages sent by the EC.</p>
          <p>- Car Node - Used as the inside portion of the elevator; handles the input of floor destination along with opening, closing the doors (simple state no control to actual doors) and displaying current floor with the same LED system as
            floor nodes.</p>
          <p>- Elevator Node - this controller interfaces with the motors and position sensor. Listens for commands from the Supervisor and reports current car position to all nodes.</p>
          <p>- Supervisor Node - Linux host communicating with PCAN; acts as the elevator state machine. It receives commands from the floor and car nodes along with the web interface. When moving to a new floor the supervisor would be the node
            responsible for telling the Elevator node to move. The supervisor alongside apache ran a MySQL instance to keep track of requests and the current state in the state machine. On the website, php was used to modify and make requests to the
            database. Javascript was used to give a live update of the car along with the recent request logs. </p>
